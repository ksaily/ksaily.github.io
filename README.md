## To login to Fitbit, you need to allow TypeAware to open supported links

If after login you are directed to this webpage and not TypeAware app, check your phoneâ€™s settings and allow TypeAware to open supported links (Long click on the app icon -> app info -> advanced -> (Open by default) open supported links) and then try logging in again) and then try logging in again. You can also do this by long clicking on the TypeAware icon on your home page and going to 'app info' and from there enable supported links. Also, if your browser asks you which app to use for opening the link, choose TypeAware.
